# AKS Diagnostics Script

This repository contains a lightweight Bash script to help you quickly diagnose common issues in an Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) cluster.

## ðŸ”§ What It Does

The script performs the following checks:

1. **Pod Status Overview** â€“ Lists all pods in all namespaces with IPs and node details.
2. **CrashLoop/Error Detection** â€“ Finds pods stuck in `CrashLoopBackOff`, `Error`, or `Pending` states.
3. **Node Conditions** â€“ Displays node readiness and health conditions (memory pressure, disk pressure, etc.).
4. **Service Map** â€“ Lists all services, types, and IP mappings across namespaces.
